OneD Robot
==========

This is an implementation of a 1D Robot.  It is comprised of only a finger that moves back and forth according to an applied force.  The finger tip interacts with an object; touching, pushing or bouncing off of it.  A force sensor on the finger tip records the touch interaction with the object.  As such this is one of the simplest robot simulations of which one can conceive.
